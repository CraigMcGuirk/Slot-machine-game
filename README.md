## How to play:

It's easy â€”
* Simply input an amount of your choice into your balance and push the enter key. 

In this version there are 4 possible outcomes, A, B, C and D with A having the highest multiplier and D having the lowest.

A slot machine (American English), fruit machine (British English), poker machine or pokies (Australian English and New Zealand English) is a gambling machine that creates a game of chance for its customers. 

Slot machines are also known pejoratively as one-armed bandits because of the large mechanical levers affixed to the sides of early mechanical machines and the games' ability to empty players' pockets and wallets as thieves would.
